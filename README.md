# ScriptWave
ScriptWave is a browser-based text editor designed to provide a seamless and feature-rich writing experience. This single-page application (SPA) harnesses the power of Progressive Web App (PWA) technology, allowing users to enjoy the benefits of a fully functional text editor within their web browser.
